A simple telegram bot which can send you vacancies using HH API and save those in history. <a href=https://t.me/InternshipGolangBot>@BotLink</a>

<h2>About</h2>

I got the idea to write this bot when I started looking for openings on headhunter and found out that I had to manually monitor the list of new, unsearched jobs by a certain criteria.

I decided to simplify the job hunting process by implementing a bot which can search for jobs by a given set of parameters, and keep a history of the vacancies I looked at, thus sending me a list of only new vacancies which i haven't seen yet.

The list of bot commands is available by using menu <a href=https://t.me/InternshipGolangBot>@BotLink</a>

<h2>How to use:</h2>

      # Put your Telegram Token (given by BotFather) into configuration file /Bot/config/config.toml
  
      make all
